# odin-react-shopping-cart
## The Odin Project - Shopping Cart

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. Create a mock shopping cart app.

## Features:
 - Users can navigate between the home and shop pages with routes using React Router
 - Shop page features products where users can adjust the quantity and add to cart
 - The cart button in the header updates the quantity as users add items to cart
 - Clicking the cart button displays the cart with product quanities, pricing, and subtotal. Users can update quantity or remove an item, and click to checkout.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - React
 - Vite
 - ESLint
 - Vitest and React Testing Library for testing
 - Netlify to deploy

## What I learned:
 - How to use React Router for client side routing
     - Using Outlets to render child components alongside the parent component
     - Using useOutletContext to pass props through the outlet to the components
 - How to test with Vitest and React Testing Library, including mocking callbacks and components, testing routing with outlets and useOutletContext
 
## Still can improve:
 - Could add pages for each product with additional details/descriptions
 - Could make a more realistic checkout process
